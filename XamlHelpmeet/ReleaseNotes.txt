RELEASE NOTES FOR XAML HELPMEET 0.3 Alpha
Copyright (c) Gil Yoder 2013

This software is an early alpha version and likely contains many
software bugs which could cause Visual Studio to lock up or
crash. The possibility of losing work exists while using this
alpha version. Use at your own risk.

While I have spent many hours looking for bugs and correcting
them, I cannot guarantee that all have been found, and corrected.
If you frequently save your work, you lesson your chances of
losing work, but be aware that anything not saved is at risk.

Please report any issues with XHM that you discover. Your help
testing this software is greatly appreciated.

some documentation, a forum to obtain help, and other information.
